I am working as an engineer since 2018, but my skill collection began long before that. Since I can remember, I liked to take things apart and build something from them. I have had many small and some bigger projects. In most of them, I have touched every part of the mechantronics field and could contribute to hardware design, manufacturing, PCB design and software developement. I canâ€™t really define my favorite field within mechatronics as I like them all.

I am always looking for new challanges. Once I conquered a difficult task, it gets boring for me and I plant my next flag. The best place for me is where I can contribute meaningfully to something big, where I can keep learning and developing new skills.

I believe in open knowledge. I think it should be free and that on the long run it is the best way for the human race to evolve. That open knowledge can lead to improved quality of life for everyone. I also understand that many times this can not work as there are many envious and thus counterproductive people but still. I owe so much to free knowledge found on the internet. Someday I want to return the favor. Either by life long contribution to society, or some original idea that may change the future for the better.
