I follow many DIY channels on YouTube and came accross <a href="https://youtu.be/c--5c3Egv4E">this one</a> back when it was released. I was dreaming for years about making one myself. Back then it would have even be a challenge but sadly had no money to spare for this. Later I only did it to tick it off my list. Although it wasn't that hard, it was still a fun project.

Some parts were purchased some were scrap laying around, like the CPU cooling unit from my old PC. I made an ergonomic handle and a battery holder on the bottom. Also I noticed that the LED had a high angle in its radiation pattern. I made a parabolic shroud with a quick-release mechanism to focus the ligth in a narrower angle.
