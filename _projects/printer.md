Heard about this new upcoming technology and wanted to try out. I researched a lot on the interned and found the <a href="https://shop.anet3d.com/products/official-anet-e10-3d-printer">perfect one</a>. Reviews said that this printer has a great price to value ratio, but if you are into tinkering, you could make that even better. Some said that it was a great product but somewhat rushed to the market and had some minor easily fixable problems.

After the included demo prints I started to print new parts to the printer itself. I remember being absolutely amazed by the fact that I could print a part for the printer that I was using to print that part. It didn't take long to start printing away all my little problems arund the house.

I wanted to print more advanced materials as well like <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acrylonitrile_butadiene_styrene">ABS</a> or <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acrylonitrile_styrene_acrylate">ASA</a> so I made a heated, insulated box for the printer.

I was really happy with the printer, used if for every project of mine, be it hobby or work. It served well and after years, marks began to show. I did my best to keep it in shape but I knew its end of service was coming.

For my next one I wanted even bigger. This time I also wanted to build it myself. I was thinking of designing one but realized it would be a tremendous task, so I started to look for open source designs. I <a href="https://hevort.com/">found one that</a> I really liked. It was well documented but there were many holes that needed creative solutions. I had to make a lot of parts myself and I had to make a lot of changes to the design. It turned out to be a lot more expensive, but was going to be bigger, faster, more precise.

I successfully built it, installed and configured firmware on it and started printing with it. One thing I have not realized that I did all of this in a sublease, so I had to move with it. It was not as fun as building it... At the end I moved it to the new company I started working at. My printer had good company there.

I just started to reach the full potential of it, slowly but surely tuning and upgrading it into perfection but then I left that company too. I had to move it to my parents garage, far from me â˜¹. I guess some projects are just privileged to ones with houses.
