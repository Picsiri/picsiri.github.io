The purpose of these trials is best described by the company itself in their <a href="https://sagaxcommunications.com/projects/drone-detection/">project description</a>.

I had many roles in this project. I managed deployment to field trials. Handled the equipment, recorded and and later analyzed the data. I also helped with designing and printing mechanical parts and the antenna. I also made a development software for displaying the data from the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Direction_finding">DF</a> system in real time. You can see the software on the images in <a href="https://sagaxcommunications.com/drone-detection-field-test-trial/">this post</a>.

I could make use of my piloting knowledge and drone equipment as well. When it came to live target testing, I was the pilot or the one that programmed the mission for the autopilot.

There were a few dozen field deployments with various systems and goals, drone detection was only one of them. As any experiment some went well, some were a total disaster. Weather conditions, equipment failures, human errors and luck all played a role. Overall, it was a great experience and I always had fun.
