When it came to the annual examination of my car, I decided to fix it myself, after all, it couldn't be <b><i>that</i></b> difficult. I dared to do it partly because I learned a bit of welding in school but mostly because my uncle has a small garage shop with every tool one would need for such a task. He also has welding equipment and a lot of experience and helped me a lot. There were a lot of holes to fix on that old car so it was a good practice.
