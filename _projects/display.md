I first started working on multiple displays then I switched from 4:3 old stlye to a landscape 16:9 one and didn't throw out the old one. This was around 2013. I experienced a the advantages of the screen area and was pursuing mutli-screen setups whenever I could. My first decent setup was when I bought two wall mounts and identical FullHD displays. I also added mood and desk lights that later got inregrated into the display stand.

<div class="row align-items-center">
    <div class="col-6">
        {% include figure.html path="assets/img/monitor/bar.mp4" title="LED bar before installation" class="video-fluid" controls="true" loop="true" muted="true" %}
    </div>
    <div class="col-6">
        {% include figure.html path="assets/img/monitor/monitors.mp4" title="Wall mounted displays" class="video-fluid" controls="true" loop="true" muted="true" autoplay="true" %}
    </div>

I liked this setup and used it for years but as my exprience and knowledge of computer tools grew, I started to use more and more programs. I started to run out of screen area and once again had to start using excessive amount of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alt-Tab">ALT-TAB</a>. The logical next step was to add two more displays and essetially upgrade to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/4K_resolution">4K</a>. So I designed and built a custom stand.
