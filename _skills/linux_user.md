When I got my first laptop, I had to use it with linux for a while as Microsofts drivers were so bad that the laptop was unusable. At first it was overwhelming, but after a while I got used to it and I started to like it. Later as the drivers were fixed I made my laptop dual boot and kept using Linux.

I also liked the ideology that linux users have. Almost everything is open, packages are mainained and collected in repositories, updates are simple and efficient. I realized many points where Microsoft was copying linux as well. In fact, I would have changed to linux for good if it was not for the many engineering softwares that I use.

I have used linux for solving tasks that were not possible on Windows, namely cloning with <a href="https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/dd-command-linux/">dd</a>, compiling firmware that's enviroment was set up in linux and WSL was not released yet.
