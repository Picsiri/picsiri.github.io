I learned the basics of CAD in university on SolidWorks, but I as I was using Autodesk AutoCAD before, I decided to use Inventor. I learned the pitfalls of designing by trial and errors. I used Inventor to make the models for my <a href="{{ '/projects/thesis/' | relative_url}}">thesis work</a> and <a href="{{ '/projects/printer/' | relative_url}}">3D printer project</a>.

I like to be methodical and build my models resilient. Although I am fast with the program, I like to take the time to make sure that my models are built in a way that modifications small modifications don't collapse the whole model. I use external references rarely and carefully.

Later as I switched employers, I had to use SolidWorks. At first it was strange, but I got to like it as well. With the emphasis on additive manufacturing, I leaned to design for that, thinking alwas about how to make the model printable.
