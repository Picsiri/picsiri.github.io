I started with an 80W not temperature control soldering iron. I made terrible joints.

Later I got myself a <a href="https://wiki.geekworm.com/TS100">portable one</a>. I used this for many of my projects. The main advantage of it was that I could use it with my laptop charger and with LiPo batteries on the field. 2016

My soldering got real good when I started working and using a <a href="https://store.metcal.com/en-ap/shop/soldering-desoldering/soldering-desoldering-systems/mx-series/MX-500S">good soldering iron</a>. I was soldering for hours every day. As I was getting better, I got ever more precise solder requiring boards. After a small warmup, I can easily solder 0402 and QFN components by hand. 2018

I also have a small experience in populating panels with pick and place machines as during <a href="{{ '/projects/AMR/' | relative_url}}">one of my projects</a>, I signed up to go and help with the production of the boards in a manufactory. 2022
