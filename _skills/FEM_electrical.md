I experimented some times with electromagnetic simulations in high school but nothing relevant. In a company I worked closely with an RF engineer. He used complex software packages and has showcased many times it's capabilities.

My first serious attempt to simulate something was in a later employment, where I <a href="{{ '/projects/FEMM/' | relative_url}}">had to simulate</a> a magnetic sensor and it's sensitivity to enviromental noise. As I was not in a position to do that, I had no access to company software so I used a free software called <a href="https://www.femm.info/wiki/HomePage">FEMM</a>. It was a short run but did some research on the topic and I was able to simulate the sensor. As the simulator is a static one, I learned to use the simulator's python interface to script a dynamic simulation. 2022
