I can weld and leave a nice weld bead. I had some chances to practice it during some of my projects, one of them being the <a href="{{ '/projects/welding/' | relative_url}}">fixing the holes on my car</a>. Can differentiate welding types. 

As I can not set the welding machine up, I am declaring myself as a weak welder.
