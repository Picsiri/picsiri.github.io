I started tinkering with electricity before I could define electrical current. Soldering wires with no temperature controllable iron, burning out LEDs, short circuiting things, etc. 2012?

In high school we started learning about electricity so the flame reignited. I started learning about electronics and how to design circuits. As I did not meet with the concept of breadboards I started right away with <a href="{{ '/projects/home-pcb/' | relative_url}}">PCB design and manufacturing</a>. 2016

As I stared working at a company, I got introduced to Altium Designer. It was way better then the softwares I used before. I started designing PCBs for the company. 2019

Since then I have designed, manufactured, tested and debugged some of PCBs. Two of the greatest projects' highlits:

<h4><a href="{{ '/projects/synth/' | relative_url}}">4CH synthesizer</a></h4>
- 6 layer PCB
- Mixed digital and analog circuitry

<h4><a href="{{ '/projects/AMR/' | relative_url}}">Mini AMR</a></h4>
- 4 layer PCB
- Great number of features / functional blocks
- Inegration of Altium and Solidworks
