I can fly my hexacopter manually and can plot a flight path with <a href="https://ardupilot.org/planner/">Mission Planner software</a>. I have flown it in many different environments and have a good understanding of the limitations of the drone.

I also participated in a piloting course for aggriultural drone pilots. Learned to use DroneDeploy to prepare a flight plan and to fly the drone and create surveys, orthomosaics and 3D models. 2021
