At my work at <a href="https://sagaxcommunications.com/">Sagax Communications</a>, I have worked with analog electronics. I had to be able to understand, install and test them. Later I had to <a href="{{ '/projects/synth/' | relative_url}}">design digital circuits</a> that were close to analog circuits.

I got to put my theoretical knowledge of waves and signals into practice. Some of the concepts I have learned:
- termination or reflection of signals
- transmission lines and impedance matching
- antenna radiation pattern and gain
- importance of grounding shielding
- difference of switching and linear power regulators
- working principle of op-amps and filters
