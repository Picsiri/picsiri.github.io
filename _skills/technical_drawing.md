I always liked to sketch thigs as I realized that there are things that would require a thousand words but could be drawn with a few lines. I had a semester of descriptive geometry where we had to render images of 3D shapes manually. Although many hated, I liked it.

When I finished the semester of technical drawing, I wanted to make use of that knowledge right away and looked for a job where I could use it. I found one in company where I had to use AutoCAD. The engineers there showed me how you can use shortcuts to draw up a part in seconds.

Although I don't know all the welding and surface finish symbols by heart, I am confident in generating drawings from 3D models.
