I had little coding experiments in high school, setting up Android Studio, making simple one page apps that only had a textbox in them. I had no idea what I was doing, but I was fascinated by the fact that I made an app. I came up with an idea of an educational game app that I wanted to make. As I had barely any knowledge and had other projects to work on, I haven't started working on it. 2014

Many years passed and collected a lot of knowledge. Although I still had no idea about mobile coding, I have filled a lot of gaps sorrounding it. I became power user on windwos and linux, I learned how to use git, command line tools, enviroment setups, etc. Life brought me the opportunity to do get started with it so I took it. 2022

I have built my knowledge and the codebase of the app, exploring many side branches during that. I spent 3 months working on it and I am at a point where the core app is working. It requires a lot of polishing, hope to release it ASAP. 2023
