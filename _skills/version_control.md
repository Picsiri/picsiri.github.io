I have known and used just to try it for a long time before I needed to use it daily in my work. In one of my previous jobs I was working on a project with other colleagues and using git finally became necessary for me. 2021

Later in a project of mine, I used git and GitHub heavily to keep track of my work. I rarely used the command line directy, but am familiar with the capabilities of git and can look up quickly if I need more than the dedicated buttons can do in VSCode and git-gui. 2023
