I like to use the online simulator <a href="https://www.falstad.com/circuit/">Circuit Simulator</a> to simulate simple circuits. I am good with this tool but as it is a basic one, I would state that overall I am weak in this area.

I also have used <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LTspice">LTSpice</a> to <a href="{{ '/projects/balast/' | relative_url}}">simulate a ligth tube driver circuit</a>.
