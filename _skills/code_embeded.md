I have started with microcontroller programming even before university. As most hobbyists I have started with Arduino and made some projects with it. 2015

I had a semester about the basisc of MCUs that was a hardware course. It was about the architecture of MCUs, memory handling, data lanes, functional blocks, etc. It was a great course and I liked it a lot. My only regret was that they were teaching about PIC MCUs and I was using Arduino that mainly supported AVR MCUs back then. 2018

I started using my knowledge in a professional enviroment as I started working at a company that was developing a product that required MCUs. After some projects I realized that the hardwares that I have been using were ancient (328p, 32u4, 2560) and I started to look for something more modern. I have found STM32 boards that were supported by the Arduino framework and that is how I started using them. As the capabilities of the boards I designed increased so did the complexity of the code. I wanted to change the Arduino framework and IDE and I found PlatformIO and its suggested editor, VSCode. 2021

As I kept learning about the insanely feature rich and  complex STM32 MCUs I started to meet with more and more limitations of the Arduino framework. First I could circumvent them by using HAL funcions called from the Arduino framework, but at some point I decided to start seriously learning it. I set up STM32CubeIDE and started to learn how to use it. Unfortunately I have not had the time to finish the learning process as I left the company and the project. 2022
