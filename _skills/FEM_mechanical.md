First time I heard about this was in university. We had a course where the professor mentioned it when talking about the forces acting in the members of a structure.

Later I used the built in FEM simulation in Inventor to design and simulate a structure that needed to be able to support and rotate a car. I got some results but I did not understand them very well and the structure was never built.
