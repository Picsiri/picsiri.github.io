I met the concept of G-code when I got my <a href="{{ '/projects/printer/' | relative_url}}">first 3D printer</a>. I did not go deep into it back then. 2018

At university we had a semester of NC programming. The teacher was rigorous about understanding each command very well. We were expected to handwrite NC-code based on a technical drawing and a technical requirements list. We also had a chance (albeit a bit short and few for me) to try out the some CNC machines in the workshop. 2019

In practice I used to modify G-codes generated by additive manufacturing slicing software <a href="https://ultimaker.com/software/ultimaker-cura">Ultimaker CURA</a>. As I worked with 3D printers a lot, there were some occasions when I had to modify the G-code for various reasons. 2021
