My favorite simulation result (not mine):

<div class="row align-items-center">
    <div class="col-11 mx-auto">
        {% include figure.html path="https://i.imgur.com/PIOafIe.jpg" title="Aerodynamics of a cow" class="img-fluid rounded z-depth-1" %}
    </div>
</div>

I want to be able to run it myself one day.
