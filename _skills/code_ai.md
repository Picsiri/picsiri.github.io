I had a semester that's subject was AI but it was more about the theory and math behind it. I have been watching a lot of videos about AI and machine learning. I enjoy the topic and would like to try it in practice some day. 2019

Have downloaded and tinkered with some premade AI libraries but still I would say my coding experience with AI is zero.
