I started using computer on WindowsXP but was too young to understand any of it. The first OS I dug deeper into was Windows7 that I got not long after its release. 2010

I have skipped Windows8 and 8.1 and switched to Windows10 in its early access phase. 2015

During this time I had many reasons and tasks that required me to explore different depths and functionalities of Windows. Today I like to think that I am a Windows power user. I can set up automated tasks, am using CMD and PowerShell regularly and can troubleshoot most of the problems I encounter. I also have <a href="https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/powertoys/">PowerToys</a> installed.

Currently I am waiting for the judgment of the crowd on Windows11 and will consider upgrading if it is worth it.
