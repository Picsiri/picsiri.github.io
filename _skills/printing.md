Have been using 3D printers for a while now. I have a good understanding of their structure, software and hardware thanks to my <a href="{{ '/projects/printer/' | relative_url}}">3D printer build project</a> and my work at a company where I had to handle a lot of 3D printers.

I can handle most of the issues that may occur during printing. Can diagnose and fix most of the printer settings. I can use the slicer software Cura to optimize the print settings for the best results.
